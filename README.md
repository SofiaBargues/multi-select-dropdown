# Multi-Select Dropdown Component Challenge

## Objective:

Create a **multi-select dropdown component** using **React**. This component will allow users to select multiple options (US states in this case) from a dropdown menu and display the number of selected options. This challenge is designed to test your understanding of React, state management, and handling user input dynamically.

## Requirements:

1. **Dropdown Menu**:

   - Display a list of US states in the dropdown.
   - The user should be able to select one or multiple states from the dropdown.

2. **Selected States Counter**:
   - Display the number of states currently selected by the user.
3. **State Management**:
   - Store the selected states in the component's state.
   - Ensure that this state updates dynamically as the user selects or deselects states.
4. **Dynamic Feedback**:
   - As states are selected, the component should update the count of selected states in real time.
   - Display the total number of selected states within the component interface.
